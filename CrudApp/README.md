# CrudApp

A simple React Native application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Overview

This application provides basic functionality for managing a list of items (likely todos based on the project structure). It serves as a fundamental example of data manipulation in a React Native environment using Expo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator/simulator

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd React-Native/CrudApp
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
2.  **Open the app:**
    - Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.
    - Or, press `a` to run on an Android emulator, `i` to run on an iOS simulator, or `w` to run in the web browser.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application screens and navigation logic (using Expo Router).
- `assets/`: Static assets like images and fonts.
- `data/`: Contains sample data (e.g., `todos.js`).
- `app.json`: Expo configuration file.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
